## Submitting a theme or site

Create a new pull request with a new `index.md` file using a specific file name and path:

```
/src/submissions/YOURTHEMENAMEORSITENAME/index.md
```

Use the following template for the contents of the `index.md` file:

``` md
---
title: Theme Name
description: Short description
date: 02-28-1938 # Submission date
tags:
  - site # Must include site or theme, can include 1 other descriptive tag (see other submissions for reference)
  - theme
links:
  repo: https://github.com/username/reponame # Optional
  download: https://themedownload.link # Optional
  demo: https://demo.url # Link to theme demo or site
author:
  name: Your Name
  url: https://yourpersonal.site
images:
  - 1.jpg # Screenshots
  - 2.jpg
  - 3.jpg
---

A somewhat brief description of your theme or site. You can put maybe a paragraph or two in here, list some features too if you like
```

Alongside the new `index.md` file you can add screenshots as `.jpg` files. The dimensions should be `1080` by `840` in pixels. Here's an example of the file structure:

``` txt
/src/submissions/YOURTHEMENAMEORSITENAME/
    index.md
    1.jpg
    2.jpg
    3.jpg
```
