Forsman Brewing is really just me [(Mark Forsman)](https://twitter.com/mforsman "Mark Forsman on twitter") crafting five gallons at a time in NYC. I love the process and have been brewing since early 2011. After a friend asked if I wanted to split the initial setup costs, I jumped in and began a hobby that has evolved into an important part of my life. The friend that split the costs eventually lost interest, but continues to reap the benefits of the monster he's created.
