## What does this site do then?

Anchor Showcase is a site dedicated to exhibiting the very best sites using Anchor CMS. Presenting a wide range of design styles that show off what Anchor can really do for the web design industry.

## I recognise you from somewhere though

Anchor Showcase is the sister site of [Anchor Themes](https://anchorthemes.com), which showcases themes built for Anchor CMS. Due to the popularity of Anchor over the past year Anchor Showcase was put in place to bring focus and dedication to sites using the system.

Anchor Showcase was created, and is maintained by, [David Darnes](https://twitter.com/DavidDarnes).
