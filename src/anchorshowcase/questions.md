## Can I submit a theme I made using Anchor CMS?

Yes you certainly can, [follow these instructions](https://anchorthemes.com/submit/) on our sister site!

## Why isn't my site up yet?

If the site isn't quite up to scratch we may not put it on the site straight away, instead we'll give you some pointers to help you out.

Please bear in mind that the site isn't maintained 24 hours of the day and it might take some time for your theme to appear on the site. But we'll try and get them on there as soon as we can.
