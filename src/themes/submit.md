## Adding your theme to Anchor Themes

Adding a theme to our site is very easy, all it takes a well maintained GitHub repo.

## Submitting

Create a new pull request to [our open source Anchor Themes site repo](https://github.com/daviddarnes/anchorthemes.com/) with a new `index.md` file using a specific file name and path:

```
/src/themes/YOURTHEMENAME/index.md
```

Use the following template for the contents of the `index.md` file:

``` md

A somewhat brief description of your theme. You can put maybe a paragraph or two in here, list some features too if you like
```

Alongside the new `index.md` file you can add screenshots as `.jpg` files. The dimensions should be `1080` by `840` in pixels. Here's an example of the file structure:

``` txt
/src/themes/yourthemename/
    index.md
    1.jpg
    2.jpg
    3.jpg
```

Here's a handy [link for creating a new theme file](https://github.com/daviddarnes/anchorthemes.com/new/master/src/themes/themes). Please ensure the pull request meets these criteria or else the addition will not get merged in. Happy theming! ðŸŽ‰
