Everything starts out with paper and pen. I think about interactions before I even consider visuals. I go straight from sketches to high fidelity designs. I work in Sketch or Photoshop and couple mockups with interactive prototypes. For web based projects, I take my mockups to the browser. My websites are responsive and retina-ready (no blurry pixels here).
