**Remember when someone told you "size isn't everything"? Well, they were right.**

Ticket for Anchor CMS is designed to be small but powerful. Utilising all the features and options Anchor has to offer.

Not only is this a good theme to roll with but also a great starting point for your own theme. Cut, paste, delete, do whatever you like. All I ask is that you show me what you come up with. Works in all the browsers (including IE 8 and up).

It's your ticket out of here.
