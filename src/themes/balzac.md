Balzac is a new, fluid & responsive theme for Anchor. It's gloriously beautiful and suited to long form. Built on a SCSS foundation, it's organised and awesome.

This is built on Semantic.gs grid framework which I edited a bit to make it fluid. I hope you enjoy using, forking, whatever-ing this theme as much as I did making it.
