## Can I submit a site I made using Anchor CMS?

Yes you certainly can, [follow these instructions](https://anchorshowcase.com/submit/) on our sister site!

## GitHub, do I have to?

Of course not, we recommend GitHub because it's free and provides us with all the information, links and files we'll need to add your theme to our site. If you are able to provide all the things we stated above somewhere else thats fine.

## Why isn't my theme up yet?

If the theme isn't quite up to scratch we may not put it on the site straight away, instead we'll give you some pointers to help you out. Every theme is tested with generic content that you'll see on the theme preview images.

Please bear in mind that the site isn't maintained 24 hours of the day and it might take some time for your theme to appear on the site. But we'll try and get them on there as soon as we can.
