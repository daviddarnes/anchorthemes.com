## What does this website do then?
Anchor Themes is a site devoted to showcasing the best themes available for the ever more popular Anchor CMS. Theming for Anchor is a doddle and using Anchor is even easier. Anchor has been specifically designed to be fast, lightweight and of course simple. Allowing you to just write.

## How did Anchor Themes come to be though?
After quite a positive discussion between myself Dave and Rob about how great Anchor CMS is to not only use but also to theme for, Rob asked the fateful question. "Is the domain anchorthemes.com taken?", normally I'd be hot on it and already punching the name into nearest domain directory but in this case I was far too interested in what the name meant.

A site showcasing awesome themes for Anchor CMS, giving people a singular place to discover & inspire users to either use Anchor CMS or even theme for it.
